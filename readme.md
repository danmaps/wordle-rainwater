I wanted to learn pyscript, so I made this. It seems to work!

## What?
See the following [classic leetcode problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/):

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

<b>Input</b>: height = `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`<br>
<b>Output</b>: `6`<br>
<b>Explanation</b>: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`. In this case, `6` units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.<br>


## What does this have to do with Wordle?
After looking at wordle scores, _every single day_, I started to wonder if/how I could compute how much rainwater would be trapped by this as an "elevation map". I also wondered how easy it would be to put this on a webpage with pyscript. Turns out, pretty easy!

Given the following wordle score:
```
Your wordle score ?/6
   
â¬›â¬›â¬›â¬›â¬›
â¬›â¬›â¬›â¬›ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬›â¬›â¬›ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬›ğŸŸ©â¬›ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬›ğŸŸ©â¬›ğŸŸ©
```


we can imagine  the following elevation map and determine that it "traps" 7 units of rain water.
```
[3, 0, 2, 0, 4]
7 water
â¬›â¬›â¬›â¬›â¬›
â¬›â¬›â¬›â¬›ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©
```
neat!
